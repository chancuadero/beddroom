            <span>M</span>y favourite room is my bedroom. I love it because it is the only room in my house where I can lock myself away from the rest of the world. After a long day, all i want to do is go up to my cosy bedroom and either listen to some mellow music, or lie down, unwind and watch a bit of t.v or maybe even a relaxing film.

            My bedroom is a very special and different room. Through the day it's a relaxing sanctuary but through the night where all my wildest dream and fantasy's can be let loose into the tender world.

            In my bedroom, I feel safe because I can be myself and nobody ever stops me from doing anything. Just by seeing how beautiful my room looks makes me want to go and stay in there every day. After is has been a long day, and I get home all I do is run straight to my bedroom and listen to music. Even I lie down on my cosy bed and watch t.v or anything interesting that comes up. On the walls of my room I have pictures of my favorite band, pictures of when I met them, even pictures of me. My bedroom is the only place where I can make it look creative and decorate however I want.
